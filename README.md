### Technologies Used
*What technologies did you use while developing this project?* Javascript, Jquery, HTML, CSS

###Existing features
*What features does your new racing app have?* Two new buttons that change the player color. New game is object oriented. 

###Planned features
*What changes would you make to your project if you continued with it in the future?* Fix the bugs that make the "reset button" only reset certain game cells. Also when a player changes his or her color and then continues to move forward the next cells change to the  start color, not the selected color. 

Instructions: 
Use the ";" and "a" key to move players forward. The change color buttons changes the players' color. The reset button resets the board.
